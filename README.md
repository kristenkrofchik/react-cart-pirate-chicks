# Pirate Chicks Vintage

Pirate Chicks Vintage is an ecommerce website for the vintage shop I own and operate with my mom. It was made with PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express and React.

### User Flow

A user will enter the site via the homepage. From there, they will use a navigation bar to view the shop's product inventory, which is stored on the backend in a PostgreSQL database. The user will be able to view the products by a variety of criteria, including date added, price, name and category. The user interface on the frontend was created with React. The React code makes calls to the website's API on the Node.js backend to display the products and other relevant information.

A user can register for the site, or log in if already registered, to add items to their shopping cart. When they are finished shopping, a user can purchase the items in their cart. The user data, including basic registration data, address, and payment information, will also be saved in the site's PostgreSQL database.

### Status
This project is still in process. Version 1 will be deployed in October, 2021. Future versions of the project will include more functionality including a contact form and newsletter signup.
